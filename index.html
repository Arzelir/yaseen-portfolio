            My strong collaboration and interpersonal skills have helped me in various opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working in fast-pace environments have helped me become adaptable, and practice my problem-solving and
            creative thinking skills.

          <p>
            I have developed strong collaboration skills having worked with many people from different age groups and
            cultures.          
          </p>

              <p>
                The Chemosynthesis Project is the second project I will be doing as part of the NASA Spaceapps hackathon. This challenege is to research and develop a concept for a planet that survives using chemosynthesis, as opposed to photosynthesis that is currently used.

                I was tasked to engineer an atm program that would have all of the functions of a typical ATM, such as knowing the balances of user's accounts, add fees if the user is from a different bank, being able to deposit and withdraw money, and convert currency to other types.
